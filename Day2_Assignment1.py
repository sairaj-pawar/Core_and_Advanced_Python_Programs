#Assignment 1 - Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
# Take input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))  # Getting the first number from the user
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))  # Getting the second number from the user

# Perform multiplication and addition
multiplication = num1 * num2  # Multiply the two numbers
addition = num1 + num2  # Add the two numbers

# Display the results
print("Multiplication of two numbers:", multiplication)  
print("Addition of two numbers:", addition)



'''output
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Multiplication of two numbers: 15
Addition of two numbers: 8
